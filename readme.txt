A Robotics workshop was conducted by the Robotics Club of our college(PICT Robotics Club) and they taught and guided us in making a gesture controlled bot, that responds to the movements of our hand.
The Workshop was a 3 day long event, in which the 1st day consisted of just the introduction to the club as well as the plan of action that was going to be followed by us for the next 2 days. 
On the 2nd day, we dealt with the electrical and mechanical domain of building the bot. We were handed all the required equipments and components of the bot.
We started with the mechanical domain 1st, where we were taught how the chassis is made and designed for the bot. Our bot had a claw in the front, that could be used to hold onto things. This claw was 3D printed using the 3D printers in our college. We were taught how to design objects for 3d printing using the Autodesk Fusion application. We designed the claw and made a 3D sketch of it using tools provided in the Autodesk Fusion application. The Chassis was built by laser cutting the metal sheets and then joining them together. It was my first time using an application like Autodesk Fusion and I was really fascinated by the idea of designing and printing 3D objects.
We then started with the electrical domain of building the bot where we Were taught how to use a microcontroller(We Used ESP32) and also how to design a circuit using KiCad software. Using KiCad we successfully planned and designed our circuit, ensuring each and every component(DC Motors, Motor drivers, IC, Microcontroller, Servo Motor) in the circuit received the appropriate amount of input voltage and were receiving commands from the microcontroller readily. After designing the circuit, we assembled and connected all the electronic parts using a breadboard and connecting wires. I was really surprised to see all the effort that goes into making a circuit, from a distance it may seem like "it's just connecting everything with each other using wires, what's the big deal in that?", but when you really get into it, you realise how much attention to detail and caution is needed in creating a fully functional circuit. 1 fault, 1 mistake and it could cost you your entire bot. I was really intrigued to see that so much is going on beneath the mess of wires and there's so much thought and effort that goes in for each and every part of this domain.
At the end of day 2, we had the outer body of the bot fully functional and ready. It was just waiting for its soul, the program that it was supposed to follow, which brings us to day 3 of our workshop, where we learned about the programming and coding domain of the Club.
We started Day 3 with learning how to use the Arduino IDE, a software used to transmit commands from the microcontroller to the respective components. It had a different syntax from traditional programming languages altogether, but I could underdstand what each block of code was supposed to do and what it meant. It was really fun to try this new language. We wrote 2 prograams in Arduino, 1 for controlling the bot using a joystick on our mobile phone and another for gesture conrtrol. The joystick would connect to the ESP32 microcontroller via bluetooth using an applicaation known as Dabble. For the gesture controlled program, we used python for taking input thrught the laptop's webcam. For this, we used the cv2 library, which had in built functions to recognise and track hands and hand gestyres. We made a 3*3 grid on the input display, and provided each section of the grid with their own specific function. I was so engrossed in this segment of the workshop that hours flew by while coding and I had no idea. 
It truly was an interesting part of technology that I got the chance to be familiar with thanks to the Robotics Club. We were introduced to many perplexing ideas like Machine Learning and IOT, which really piqued my interest in Robotics as a whole. I really enjoyed my time at the workshop and I got to learn a lot of cool stuff with it. I am looking forward to taking part in more projects and Activities like these, and perhaps discovering and learning more about these technologies.
